        I, Caitlyn, just really like have an obsession with dragons and shiny things. The entire deal of dragon eggs being related to both of those things is why the Egg Emporium started. It's technically meant to simulate a situation of a store in a fantasy setting selling actual dragon eggs, but in our reality the little crafted ones will have to do.

        Well first fixed up the navigation bar styling, by adding spaces, consistant looks, and fixing the width issue. Said nav bar is using script (js). Added an inventory search screen for ease of user use. Adjusted/added pages to make sure an accidental "logout" doesn't happen while navigating this site. Added the cart, user settings, and orders pages. Looking to add in examples into such pages like orders. Many graphical errors resolved.
