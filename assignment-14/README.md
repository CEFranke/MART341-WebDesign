How did your user testing sessions go?

User testing was quite insightful. One user was well versed in computer related things, including the creation of websites and were about to help point out areas of technical issues or design that I could improve. Another user had no experience in that topic, and as a more "generic" user was able to provide more insight about what non-computer people could find confusing or interesting.

What changes (if any) did you make to your website based on the user feedback you received?

Mostly added specification for if certain features were not exactly usable. Like the search page can't work on a static file kind of warning. Plans on making the words on the site a bit easier to read.

Optional: What challenges did you face this week, and how did you overcome them?

My biggest challenge is the default problem of storing information in a static file (like html). Trying to eliminate any inconsistencies...
