Web Development
Assignment-04

1) Very briefly detail how browsers function. List any browsers you currently use to surf - or even develop for - the web.

A Browser is the application that allows one to view things like websites.
Browsers themselves are bound to work differently from one another, as how they present information is based on their construction.
They interpret files they receive, offer a user interface, render the information onto the screen.
The most common browsers that I use is Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, but I used to use FireFox all the time.


2) Link to your screenshot using a relative URL. (We did this last week, too! Check your assignment-03 directory if you can't remember how you did it).
