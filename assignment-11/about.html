        I, Caitlyn, just really like have an obsession with dragons and shiny things. The entire deal of dragon eggs being related to both of those things is why the Egg Emporium started. It's technically meant to simulate a situation of a store in a fantasy setting selling actual dragon eggs, but in our reality the little crafted ones will have to do.

        What can you see for pseudo selectors?
      </p>
      <p>
        You can hover over the links in the nav bar for a background color change. You can over over the title on the main page for a line spacing change. You can select different options on the main page which will change color depending on what is selected.
