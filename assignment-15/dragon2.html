      <h2>
        Most individuals don't actually care about the difference between dragon like entities. Large scaly reptile (likely with wings) is more than enough to make people say "Thats a dragon". In reality there is a lot more nuanced definitions, specifically with the names of various draconic types telling you how the little beastie is built.
