        I, Caitlyn, just really like have an obsession with dragons and shiny things. The entire deal of dragon eggs being related to both of those things is why the Egg Emporium started. It's technically meant to simulate a situation of a store in a fantasy setting selling actual dragon eggs, but in our reality the little crafted ones will have to do.

        This instance had examples put into the site on the cart, orders, and invoices. It also now has a "functioning" signup page. At this point there is mostly some back end clean up to do, maybe minor style adjustments, and other caretaking. Certain features 'presented' here will not be functional due to the static (not dynamic) nature of html. All posts have been turned into buttons with 'on-click' to navigate the site, because apparently Github is allergic to posts and will break if you use them ("405 - Not Allowed Error"). As such no inputs that required being filled in will work.
