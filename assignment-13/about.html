        I, Caitlyn, just really like have an obsession with dragons and shiny things. The entire deal of dragon eggs being related to both of those things is why the Egg Emporium started. It's technically meant to simulate a situation of a store in a fantasy setting selling actual dragon eggs, but in our reality the little crafted ones will have to do.

        What the current state of progress?

        Well first implimented was a new navigation bar with proper handling to help with future endevors in trying to make a "functional" login, without a database or php. Said nav bar is using script (js). Added an inventory screen for ease of user viewing of stock. Adjusted index to not be a full shopping page anymore. Edited the style sheet a lot to try and make the nav bar look better and remove redundant code. Many features are planned like a search section of the inventory. Also looking into making a shopping cart page. Also find out what on earth is cause in mini boarder at the bottom of the nav.
