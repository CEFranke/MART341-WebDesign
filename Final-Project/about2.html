        I, Caitlyn, just really like have an obsession with dragons and shiny things. The entire deal of dragon eggs being related to both of those things is why the Egg Emporium started. It's technically meant to simulate a situation of a store in a fantasy setting selling actual dragon eggs, but in our reality the little crafted ones will have to do.

        This instance had the sizing for different screen sizes placed in, which mean a lot of code changes to use a vw sizing option instead of px. Site is at a "functional" point, with the limitation being how the static nature of html pages are what stops 'interesting/useful' features from being implimented. Back end clean up to do has been done with alt tags on images and ensuring the presence of language tags. All posts have been turned into buttons with 'on-click' to navigate the site, because apparently Github is allergic to posts and will break if you use them ("405 - Not Allowed Error"). As such no inputs that required being filled in will work.
