    <p>
      Caitlyn has always had a <em>love</em> of tea. However, she realized that it was hard to recommend a tea to friends without a decent recipe or brewing instructions to share. Not trusting online sources, she wrote down the instructions she knew by heart for how she specifically makes a London Fog.
