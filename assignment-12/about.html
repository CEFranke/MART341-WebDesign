      <h2>
        I, Caitlyn, just really like have an obsession with dragons and shiny things. The entire deal of dragon eggs being related to both of those things is why the Egg Emporium started. It's technically meant to simulate a situation of a store in a fantasy setting selling actual dragon eggs, but in our reality the little crafted ones will have to do.

        What is the navigation bar?
      </p>
      <p>
        On the index page using the header was attempeted. It was a mixed bag and honestly didn't fit the style of the site all too well. So the rest of the pages uses a heavily modified Nav bar that also has hover lists and buttons, but stays in place, and keeps things to specific sides.
