        What Are Various Draconic Types?

      <h2>
        Most individuals don't actually care about the difference between dragon like entities. Large scaly reptile (likely with wings) is more than enough to make people say "Thats a dragon". In reality there is a lot more nuanced definitions, specifically with the names of various draconic types telling you how the little beastie is built.

      <h2>
        The most common name used is actually a pretty limited definition in terms of limbs it should have. A traditional "Dragon" should be composed of 4 Legs and 2 Wings. Granted the number of wings may be higher, but not lower.
