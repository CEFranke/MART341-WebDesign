Tell me about a website you visited using the Wayback Machine.


What year is it from?

  I visited the Google Search Site from 1 September 2002.


How is the older version different from the current version today in terms of overall design?

  There is a lot more 'information' on screen, that I'm not sure of how it specifically relates to making a search. The modern site streamlines the search process and lacks the 'options' until you actually make a search, leaving you with about 2 main 'search' buttons. The 2002 version has 10+ buttons off the get go.
  I'm unsure if I have to immediately click images if I want to find images with it or not. It also really have the 'old/basic' internet look.
